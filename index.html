                Hello and welcome, I am a programmer with a passion for creating and playing video games of varying genres. Outside of programming I enjoy playing chess, as well as being
                a member of my university's Chess Club.

                            This was a six person group project that spanned six weeks. A Spirit's Tale is a platformer puzzle game with stealth elements created in Unity. The areas I worked on were the level design,
                            death and respawn mechanics, level transitions, and the player's' attack.<br /><br />
                            Working as part of a team for six weeks made me understand how to effectively collaborate with people I had never met before. I also
                            used GitHub with multiple collaboraters for the first time, which was different however gave me valuable information.

                            This project is a 3D environment I made in 3DS Max; with an animation to accompany it. The inspiration of this project was a mix between
                            Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005) and Job Simulator (2016). I created all of the assets for this project apart from the person's animation and model. I now focus on programming,
                            however I can now appriciate the work that goes into creating art within the industry.

                            This project is a 3D Environment created with DirectX11. It showcases phong lighting, file read objects, texturing, transparency and cameras.
                            I also used object oriented programming for this project.<br /><br />
                            A noteable feature of this project was the addition of XML to read values from a file which made the code cleaner.

                            Based on adventure books, this interactive game was made with HTML and CSS where the player is tasked with travelling to Severodvinsk 
                        to serve the Navy. This was my introduction to HTML and helped me make this website. You can click the button below to play.<br /><br />
