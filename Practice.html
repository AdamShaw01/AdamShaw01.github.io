                Joyce Lin (b. 1994) is an artist & sculptural furniture designer who experiments with a diverse range of materials to create works that explore the connections between outer surfaces and the 
                interior and the ongoing erosion of boundaries between our natural and artificial worlds.Lin grew up in Birmingham, AL where she attended the Alabama School of Fine Arts. Her cross-disciplinary interests led her to 
                enroll in the Brown/RISD Dual Degree Program, where she studied Furniture Design at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and Geology-Biology at Brown University, and received honors such as the Samuel Gragg Award 
                for Innovation and the Excellence in Craft Award. She has since exhibited in notable venues such as R & Company in NYC, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, 
                and the Houston Center for Contemporary Craft, with work in various private and public collections including the RISD Museum, The Mint Museum, Carnegie Museum of Art, Munson, Houston Civic Arts Collection, and 
                New Orleans Museum of Art. In addition to her art practice, Lin has taught woodworking at Houstons TXRX Labs makerspace as well as RISD. Today, Lin is based in Houston, where she produces new work at the East End Maker Hub.
