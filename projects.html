                Hello, I am an undergraduate who is studying Computer Games Programming at Staffordshire University. While studying programming I have learned DirectX11, OpenGL, GitHub - for solo and team projects, as well as other
                frameworks like SDL2. Outside of programming I spend my time playing Chess (online, at tournaments, and as a part of my university's Chess club), Minesweeper speedrunning, Skydiving, Film Photography, and playing a
                varity of video games. The games I tend to lean towards are indie games and short experimental games that explore an idea not usually explored in the industry. I've grown up playing games; from the PS2 and the Xbox,
                to building my PC to continue playing the weirdest asortmant of games that I can come up with. Hopefully my webpage will illustrate my passion for playing and creating video games.

                This project is a 3D environment I made in 3DS Max; with an animation to accompany it. The inspiration of this project was a mix between
                Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005) and Job Simulator (2016). I created all of the assets for this project apart from the animation and model of the person that appears in the animation. I now focus on programming,
                however I understand the work that goes into creating art within the industry.

            <p class="base">
                This project is an interactive story inspired by the old adventure books "Choose your own adventure" which I loved reading growing up. This game was created in Twine and I encorporated HTML and CSS to
                create a story about being tasked to travel to Severodvinsk to fight for Russia (this was created before the Russian Ukrainian war).<br /><br />Click Enter below to play the game.

                I learned a lot from this project as it was my first with OpenGL.
