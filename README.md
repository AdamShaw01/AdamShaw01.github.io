# Portfolio Website

In this website I will be trying to copy the style of the discontinued GeoCities back in the 1990's. With this comes lots of gifs, tiled backgrounds, 
auto playing music when loading up the website (which will probably not play on most computers because it is disabled by the browser by default). I will be
making it a multi webpage site so the user can click on links to go to different parts of my website. As this is my portfolio webpage I want it to still be
professional but it to stand out from the rest of the webpages that will be.
